; ----- A Program to display ASCII characters -----------------
; ----- Here it is tidied up. This version is annotated. ------
; ----- This makes it possible to understand. -----------------
; ----- The labels have been given more readable names too. ---

Start: 
	Mov BL,C0	; Make BL point to video RAM
	Mov AL,3C	; 3C is the ASCII code of the 'less than' symbol
Here: 
	Mov [BL],AL	; Copy the ASCII code in AL to the RAM location that BL is pointing to.
	CMP AL,7B	; Compare AL with '{'
	JZ Clear	; If AL contained '{' jump to Clear:
	INC AL		; Put the next ASCII code into AL
	INC BL		; Make BL point to the next video RAM location
	JMP Here	; Jump back to Here
Clear:
	MOV CL,40	; We are going to repeat 40 (hex) times
	MOV AL,20	; The ASCII code of the space character
	MOV BL,C0 	; The address of the start of video RAM
Loop: 
	MOV [BL],AL	; Copy the ASCII space in AL to the video RAM that BL is pointing to.
	INC BL		; Make BL point to the next video RAM location
	DEC CL		; CL is counting down towards zero
	JNZ Loop	; If CL is not zero jump back to Loop
	JMP Start	; CL was zero so jump back to the Start and do it all again.
	
	END
